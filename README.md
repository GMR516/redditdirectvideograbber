# Reddit Direct Video Grabber
Grab direct video links from reddit.

## Is this functional?
Yeah, somewhat. It's very basic, and the starting point of something better.

## What does it do?
Appends a link to every reddit "thing" (defined by reddit, not me), that alerts the user with the direct video link.

## Known Issues
If you're using Reddit Enhancement Suite and NeverEndingReddit, the buttons will not be appended to the new loaded posts. Additionally, there's no distinction between non-video posts and video posts.
